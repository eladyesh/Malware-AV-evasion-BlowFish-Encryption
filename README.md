# Malware-AV-evasion-BlowFish-Encryption
Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher encryption algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993. 
It is widely used in cryptography and is considered one of the fastest encryption algorithms.
Blowfish uses a key length of between 32 and 448 bits and divides the plaintext into 64-bit blocks, which are then encrypted individually. 
Blowfish is a Feistel network cipher, which means that it divides the plaintext into two halves and encrypts each half separately using a round function. 
The resulting ciphertext is the combination of the two encrypted halves.
Blowfish is a secure encryption algorithm and has not been broken so far. 
However, due to advances in computing power, it is no longer considered as secure as some of the newer encryption algorithms such as AES.
